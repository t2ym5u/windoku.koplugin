All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Generated puzzles are now guaranteed solvable by **pure deduction** — no
  guessing, ever. Previously only the uniqueness of the solution was checked,
  which is weaker: measured before the change, 35% of 9x9 "expert" grids and
  5% of "hard" ones could only be cracked by trying a digit and backtracking.
- Each difficulty is now a promise about technique, not just clue count:
  Easy never needs more than naked/hidden singles, Medium adds locked
  candidates and naked pairs, Hard adds hidden pairs and triples/quads,
  Expert adds X-Wing, Swordfish and XY-Wing.
- **Hint** button. Three taps: which row/column/box is about to give, then the
  technique and digit, then the value itself (undoable like any other move).
  Hints refuse to run while an entered value contradicts the solution, so they
  can never reason from a false premise.

### Changed
- Large grids generate considerably faster, since a dead end is now rejected by
  constraint propagation instead of a full backtracking search: 12x12 Expert
  3.5s -> 0.13s, 16x16 Expert over 60s -> 1.1s per grid.

### Fixed
- The shared game UI now speaks French (and Spanish/German) again. Its strings
  were going straight to KOReader's gettext, which knows none of them, so
  messages like "Hide result to keep playing." stayed English whatever the
  device language.
